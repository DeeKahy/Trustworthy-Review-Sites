# Trustworthy-Review-Sites
Just a file of trustworthy Review sites since everything is chatgpt garbage nowadays. Especially usefull if you want to artificially boost those websites on search engines that allow you to do so, like Kagi. Feel free to make a pull request with a site and some sort of proof that it deserves to go where you want to put it.

Create a kagi lens for the trustworthy sites so ONLY search those, by going to your settings->lenses Create a new lense and paste the contents like so (it should just be a straight copypaste).
